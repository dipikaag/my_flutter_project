               snake_time
               
You enter the App and see the Homepage screen as shown here
![first page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81377459/125933264-6efbda7e-fe50-4119-b502-f79e6c94ba2b.jpeg)

As the snake eats his food, his size grows to one more bead and so on and score increases by 5

Speed at which our snake traverses also increses with each food piece, as it gives him energy, isn't is so!!

Anyhow, as soon as the snake hits any of the four walls he will die. 
The game finishes with a choice to restart or end it and final score is displayed!!

Restart starts the game once again with score 0 and snake.length= 4 beads




End takes us to the Homescreen where we can exit the App!


Thanks!!
